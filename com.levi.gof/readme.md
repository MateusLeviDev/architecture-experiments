### Use Cases of the Factory Method Design Pattern

Below are the use cases of factory method:

    JDBC uses factories to create connections and statements. Frameworks like Spring and Guice utilize factories for managing beans.
    Swing and JavaFX uses factories to produce UI components such as buttons and text fields, offering flexibility in design.
    Tools like Log4j and Logback employ factories to create loggers with various configurations, allowing for control over logging levels.
    Serialization frameworks use factories to generate objects from serialized data, accommodating different formats and versions.
    to encapsulate object creation
    to centralize class selection code 
    when you dont know ahead of time what class object you need
